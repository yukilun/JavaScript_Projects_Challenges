## Overview
The Javascript Challenges are simply a record of my initial learning curve in basic web development - HTML, CSS and Vanilla Javascript. Obviously, some of them may not be responsive while some of the codes may not be the best. However, it gave me the opportunity to hone my coding skills. Among all the challenges, I love \"Color blind game\" and \"Wordfill\" the most as I enjoyed coding and playing them a lot! I am sure you will also have a great time playing them as well!
